# 🌌 3D Solar System Simulation

This project is an interactive and responsive **3D Solar System simulation** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the **Three.js** library. It visually represents all the planets orbiting the sun with realistic animations, orbits, and control mechanisms.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌞 A central sun surrounded by 3D planets with realistic orbits.
- 🪐 Planetary revolution around the sun with default relative speed maintained.
- 🧭 Hover over any planet to see its **name** displayed on screen.
- 🎛️ Individual **speed control sliders** for each planet.
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design with smooth 3D animations using **Three.js**.
- ⚙️ Built and served using **Vite** for lightning-fast development and production builds.
